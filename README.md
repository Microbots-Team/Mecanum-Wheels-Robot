## 📅 Project Timeline & Context

- **Event:** FMEE 2025 – **AI & Robotics Club** Open Day
- **Date:** November 10–11–12, 2025

## 💡 Project Overview

A fully mobile robot built with **ESP32** and **omnidirectional Mecanum wheels**, enabling smooth movement in any direction—forward, sideways, diagonally, and full rotation.  
The robot is controlled through a custom mobile app and equipped with an ultrasonic sensor for basic obstacle awareness.

This project showcases a versatile omnidirectional robot using Mecanum wheels.  
With four independently driven DC motors and ESP32-based wireless control, the robot can perform complex movements that traditional wheel robots cannot.  
A mobile app communicates with the ESP32 over Wi-Fi , allowing users to manually drive the robot or trigger predefined motion patterns.

The ultrasonic sensor adds basic environmental awareness, enabling safer and more interactive motion control.
